-Conceptual Understanding-
JavaScript has several basic data types, including Number, String, Boolean, Null, and Undefined. Numbers are used for calculations, strings are used for text, and booleans represent true or false values. Null represents an intentionally empty value, while undefined means a variable exists but has not been assigned a value yet. One thing that surprised me was learning that converting null to a number results in 0. I expected it to cause an error or return undefined, so this result was confusing at first. I also found it interesting how JavaScript automatically converts data types in certain situations, such as when a string is treated like a number. I can see how this might be useful, but it could also cause bugs if I’m not paying close attention.

-AI-Assisted Learning Reflection-
I used AI tools during this assignment to help me understand type conversions and logical operations. For example, I asked why null becomes 0 when converted to a number because it didn’t make sense to me at first. That explanation actually made it click for me. I thought about copying some of the code from the AI, but I decided to write it myself instead. Running my code in Node.js and checking the output helped me see how everything worked together.

-Looking Forward--
Going forward, I want to explore type coercion more, especially cases where JavaScript automatically changes data types in unexpected ways. I also want to keep practicing logical operators because seeing how true and false values interact helped me understand them better. Overall, this assignment taught me more about JavaScript data types and reminded me to be careful when writing code.
